## Housing Details
The house will hold the five of us for $214.79 a night for 7 nights. This is a $1,500 charge for rent alone. With added fees for tax, service, renting, and housekeeping, our total housing budget for the whole trip will be $1,947. We've decided to round this up to $2,000 to be generous and safe.
