## Total Budget
Our designated budget was $3400.
1947 + 251 + 315 + 875 = 3388.
Considering how many things were rounded up in anticipation of issues or emergencies (anticipating gas prices to be $3.30 a gallon, potential oil changes, anticipating expensive meals), saying that we are $12 under budget is likely unrealistic. We are more likely 50-100 dollars under budget.
